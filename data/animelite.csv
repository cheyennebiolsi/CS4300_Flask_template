The Inter Solar System Police attempts to keep peace in the galaxy, aided in part by outlaw bounty hunters, referred to as ""Cowboys."" The ragtag team aboard the spaceship Bebop are two such individuals.  Mellow and carefree Spike Spiegel is balanced by his boisterous, pragmatic partner Jet Black as the pair makes a living chasing bounties and collecting rewards. Thrown off course by the addition of new members that they meet in their travelsâ€”Ein, a genetically engineered, highly intelligent Welsh Corgi; femme fatale Faye Valentine, an enigmatic trickster with memory loss; and the strange computer whiz kid Edward Wongâ€”the crew embarks on thrilling adventures that unravel each member's dark and mysterious past little by little.  Well-balanced with high density action and light-hearted comedy, Cowboy Bebop is a space Western classic and an homage to the smooth and improvised music it is named after.

Claiming that she will die if he doesn't kiss someone within 24 hours, Guri's pleas of desperation are misunderstood as pleas for love, leading Seiji to kiss the cute stranger that came barging into his house. In actuality, it turns out that this cosplaying cupid is the wielder of a Kiss Note, in which any pairing of names she writes will kiss and become a couple. Guri explains that she misspelt and accidentally wrote Seiji's name while indulging in her yaoi fantasies, but because she had yet to pair him with anyone, their kiss was meaningless. Even worse, Guri reveals that if Seiji is not coupled with anyone soon, not only will she die, but Seiji will remain a virgin for eternity!  Eager to escape his fate, Seiji sets his sights on the beautiful and popular Akane Hiyama. But after Akane hears that he kissed Guri, she reveals the obsessive and psychopathic feelings that she holds for the unfortunate boy and proceeds to viciously attack them. In the ensuing confusion, Guri is able to pair Seiji with Akane in the Kiss Note, temporarily saving Seiji from any further bodily harm. But to complicate matters, Guri's newfound feelings lead her to also pair the two of them with herself. Just when the situation could not get any more convoluted, this new coupling with Guri has turned Seiji and Akane into temporary angels, forcing them into assisting the cupid with her work of pairing humans, lest they be cast into hell. With all semblance of normality snatched from his life, Seiji gets to work at matchmaking with these eccentric girls by his side.

er be because the content they had to work with is legitimately not that interesting or because they were under a preconceived notion that Danganronpa was ONLY about characters dying, and they wanted to play it up as much as possible. Could also be both, it's annoying. It's funny because all of this is practically an emulation of those excellent episodes of Humanity has Declined (sup Seiji), but instead of becoming self-aware of their wrongdoings like the great characters in that show, the DR3 writers charge ahead without any shred of guilt regarding the manipulation of their own audience. Despicable, and definitely not an example to be followed. By the way, I have been filled in on some of what happens in Despair Arc, so I can confirm that the way the stories intertwine is horribly done and (surprisingly) makes me hate it more. Hurray for hand-waving the entire plot with the most ridiculously boring plot device imaginable! _____________________________________________________________ REVIEW TL;DR: Incredibly weak presentation on all fronts, fails at being visually interesting, has dull and idiotic dialogue, lack of attention to detail (especially in the setting), stupid plot devices that make little sense, unrelentingly boring, poorly done characters that fail at being engaging, mystery falls flat no matter if you watch this series alone or with its companion show, plot holes that contradict the series' lore, overall disappointment in every major plot point, what a disappointment. Actually, to be honest, I had low expectations to begin with. Especially when given a 12 episode run time, it's plain to see that the Danganronpa formula has no merit when converted into animated format. They could've gone in many different directions to compensate for this (such as not making it another killing game maybe??), but instead they only opted to do something VERY slightly different while simultaneous stripping the DR formula of its necessary parts, and failed spectacularly as a result. Is it possible that I've just gotten tired of Danganronpa over the years? Maybe this is true. After all, the games suffer from a few of the problems I've listed in this review and have their fair share of other annoyances. This anime certainly didn't help, I fondly remember playing Danganronpa on the Vita the day it came out. It was the same for its sequel, too. I remember absolutely loving these games and obsessing over them with my friends. Over time, after playing better games and watching better anime, my enthusiasm towards the series died down.

K-On is also a 4-Koma slice of life. The background music for these shows can be memorable, it's just not the case for me in new game but that's not to say it's bad, now obviously I'm going to remember these better, that's just always the case with anime. But the opening is actually amazing. The opening has amazing visuals, like I can't get over how well the opening is animated. We got great colors and efforts flying across the screen, we have Aoba falling backwards into the center of the screen which is done very well as purple circles pulse out from the middle that's she's falling into. Another part has her floating in the center as the other characters fly by her and touch her, spin her and lightly grab her before pushing themselves away, the flowing movement and motion in this part is greatly done and looks well. The opening also have the main four girls moving around in the office space which is beautifully animated like the rest of it and we also get an amazing moving shot from Aoba's eye outwards and as it zooms out it spins around to be behind her in a beautiful environment. The opening is easily the best animated part of the entire she and I love it to bits. The ending is a bit more simple and doesn't have nearly as much going on but the music is great, I like the music for the ED more than for the OP, the endings visuals are lacking in comparison though. It's still beautiful and I like the white dressâ€™ everyone are in, it look really pretty and gorgeous. There's also bits of pixel and sprite art mixed in which is a nice touch. The end part of the ending is extremely well animated though, it's a disc that's spinning cause it must be in use and then when it stops spinning it looks just like how a disc slowly down looks in real life. Discs slowly down in real life look weird they are going full speed and once they are meant to stop they have a brief moment when they kinda stop instantly before actually slowly down. It only looks like this because it's stopped it's consistent speed, however since it just stopped for a moment it had a jerk motion where it goes back slightly however it then resumes its speed, it's still going pretty fast so it's hard to tell what direction it's spinning in making it look like it's now going in the opposite direction. This is not the case and once it's slowed down some more you notice this and it slightly fucks with you for a sec before the disc comes to a complete stop. New games disc spin at the end of the ED pulls this off perfectly. It looks just like a real disc slowing down, I know I kinda went on about disc spinning for too long there but I wanted everyone to know what I'm talking about and how new game is able to emulate it perfectly. Which is hard to do in animation especially this were is clearly not CG. Everyone this was purposefully done for that disc spin and maybe it means nothing to everyone else but I found it incredible, they all convey how there characters would sound in real life and while they obviously don't sound real people because it's a TV show, they aren't super anime voices. Except maybe nene, maybe Aoba's is a little higher than normal but it's not as high as anime girls normally tend to get. I enjoyed new game, like I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed it a lot. It's a really good show. It's has good animation, strong visuals, an interesting story that reflects the Japanese gaming industry accurately (except for the fact that they're all girls) and some great, loveable characters. Characters is definitely the strongest point of the show and my enjoyment comes from there's characters, there interactions and the bond that I created with them. It's like a lot of our Moe, slice of life shows, it's mostly just my silly opinion, but if it's sounds like you share my opinion then please, go check it out cause it's a great show. And if it sounds like you don't share the same taste as me, then consider what I've written and see if you can get behind it

Equipped with the superhuman ability to permanently rewrite any part of his body to multiply his strength or speed, Kotarou is naturally drawn to the supernatural. One special meeting with the lone member and president of the Occult Research Club, the ""Witch"" Akane Senri, leads to Kotarou reviving the Occult Club by recruiting Kotori and three other members: the clumsy transfer student Chihaya, the strict class representative Lucia, and the unassuming Shizuru.

terial? I get not expecting too much out of the show, because there will never be that perfect adaptation which we all crave, but this is going too much into the opposite direction and makes me more than a little sad just thinking about it. I also get why Rewrite turned out the way it did. In the end, many people profited from it. 8-bit probably made decent money, Key got some cheap advertisement and the average Japanese teenager found another way to put off doing his homework for another 30 minutes during the 13 weeks the show was airing. So, why even be mad about it? True, there is no reason to be mad. But at least let me be disappointed. At this point I should probably mention that a season two for Rewrite has officially been confirmed, adapting what you could call the second half of the visual novel, the â€œanswer arcâ€ so to say. That being so, I guess that this season could potentially gain in value if its sequel manages to make up for all its failures. But can you honestly have faith in that? I for one can not. Not as long as the same people are in charge of the project. So Rewrite may return in the coming Winter season, but I don't think that I will. Summing up: Should you watch Rewrite? No. The series has very few redeeming features. The best it has to offer is boring mediocrity. All you'll end up doing is to spoil yourself on important aspects of the story in case you ever feel like reading the far superior source material. Rewrite is, without a doubt, the worst out of the Key adaptations," which is saying something when you think about how poorly put together Little Busters! was and that Toei Animation actually used to be the gaming company's go-to studio. New viewers will be thoroughly confused by the messy job the production staff did trying to put all the different elements of the visual novel together and fans will most likely be enraged by the lack of care given to the project. Just save yourself the time. If I could only â€œRewriteâ€ my memory and forget all about this mess. Ha. Ha. Ha. *sigh*""",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 main character. Rem -The Maid Every Man Wants- One of the greatest surprises in Re:Zero, for me at least, it's not hard to understand why she became so popular, but when she was first introduced, Rem didn't have much of a presence. In fact, Ram had a lot more screen time than Rem did. It wasn't even until episode 7, where we learn that Rem was the mysterious person who killed Subaru in a previous episode, that she really rises to prominence. To see why Rem is so popular, I believe the first thing we need to look at is just what Rem is. She's a maid. This might not seem like a good reason, but maids have become an exceedingly popular aspect of otaku culture, not just in Japan, but in the US as well. Maid cafes started to really explode in Japan during the early 2000s, and since then, the appeal of maids has gotten to the point where there are now several maid cafes in the United States. What makes maids such a huge hit among fans depends on who it is. For women, I believe it's the cute outfit. Let's face it, it's because maid's represent the ideal woman. They're supportive, they're loyal, and after Subaru saves her life in episode 11, Rem becomes what many men consider to be the ideal maid. Another thing that must be considered is how much we learned about Rem during the last half of the second arc. Rem has a tragic backstory that appeals to people. It pulls at their heart strings and makes you want to root for her. I think the fact that she was originally seen as the lesser of the two sisters made her feel a bit more flawed. She wasn't this perfect maid right from the start, she didn't have this impeccable talent. She cultivated it after her village was burned down and her sister lost her horn. In some ways, Rem becoming such a perfect maid was done in repentance for what happened to her sister. She believes it's her fault that Ram lost her horn and therefore her powers. To make up for this, she has strive to become as perfect as possible. I don't know if I could call this a form of self-punishment, but I can say that she's definitely beating herself up over this. Of course, this actually brings up another point of appeal for Rem. She's a demon, I feel what really made her so loved was how much screen time she got. Going through the anime after Subaru rescues her, it's easy to see that Rem is in almost every scene that Subaru is in. You always see her. Even when she's not the focal point of that particular scene, she's there in the background, as though her role was the silently support Subaru. This point about her supporting Subaru is also made clear during the many scenes in which Rem expresses her belief that Subaru is special.

y an after-credits scene that sucked all the epic-ness out of everything.  The fifteenth episode finally had the show revel in fuckery and was quite enjoyable because of it. Itâ€™s a shame that it was the only one of its kind, since this show refuses to be campy even if it is. These characters are meant to be killed, but I, personally, wouldâ€™ve loved to see a classic grind house in anime form. Itâ€™d be a pleasure to watch with friends. An increase in gore wouldâ€™ve also had a better effect on the story. Since the only way to raise these psychological stakes is to have us experience what Subaru is. You do this by showing us the gruesome results in a way that does have us recoil in nastiness. The way Re:Zero does this is just weak. It felt like Subaru didnâ€™t â€œwant to dieâ€, however, he had to, but it doesnâ€™t feel like remotely enough progression. It didnâ€™t feel like he grew too much from each death. It didnâ€™t feel like he got properly damaged, and when the show showed that he may have, it never actually solidified this kind of narrative progression. He just shifted from fiery MC to depressed boy and then was knocked out of that depression by some motivational speech. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ [The Confession] Rem spills her wish-fulfillment on Subaru and itâ€™s probably the most Iâ€™ve ever cringed at an anime before. No hate towards anyone who enjoyed this sequence, but I just felt so uncomfortable. It felt like the most pandering possible thing to do. Itâ€™s wish-fulfillment. Really just a cute girl talking about this is made for guys to fawn over and thatâ€™s about it. With that being said, Subaru is self-aware about these flaws he has. Towards the latter half of this show there is an incredibly long emotional scene between Subaru and Rem. He dishes out just about everything he has taken, about the pain, the anger, the amount heâ€™s been broken by these experiences. Whilst for me I didnâ€™t buy his trials and tribulations since they lacked any kind of emotional resonance, though. Inopportunely, these feelings are based on a sub-par narrative. When a character admits his flaws, right? Well, not for Re:Zero itâ€™s not. He gets literally all of these flaws validated. Every single one. Itâ€™s supposed to be a parallel to how he helped Remâ€™s emotional breakdown, however, it doesnâ€™t remotely feel like the same thing. Rem is straight up excusing everything heâ€™s done just because she has fallen in love with him for an equally shallow reason that heâ€™s fallen in love with Emilia. This kind of situation didnâ€™t make much sense to me. They make these clear parallelâ€™s yet do nothing with them, but more importantly, these parallels serve as a way to excuse actions that an MC who was made to be self-inserted into did. Itâ€™s the queen of all fan-service and pandering. Rem, the most waifu-bait character just validated everything that would be criticized of socially-incapable nerds. They give this corny quazi-relationship throughout a lot of this shows middle-half where Rem clearly has a big crush on him, but in ways that benefit the character. It frustrated me to no end. Regardless if he buys it or not, it happened. Hereâ€™s the saddest thing though. He rejects her. As I guessed from the first few episodes, Subaruâ€™s heart lies with the cardboard cutout waifu and not the body-pillow waifu. Since heâ€™s an anime protagonist and every girl is bound to warm up to him eventually, even Beatrice in this odd shoehorned scene of her expressing sadness over his inevitable death. So this rejection was then supplemented by Rem just kind of shrugging it off and then both of them laugh it off. I was just annoyed about this move. They had to address this relationship and made it seem like this crazy narrative maneuver but instead just made it an excuse for Rem to continue to fawn over Subaru with a potential tease of their possible relationship. It is frankly sickening how much Re:Zero wants to stick to a perceived status quo while still pretending to subvert clichÃ©s. This scene is there to maintain their relationship and the cutesy factor without actually addressing the core of the â€œMC can get emâ€™ allâ€ trope. Itâ€™s a cheap tactic that simply tries to

ant. She blindly follows Reinhard without resisting and becomes one of the eligible candidates for becoming the ruler, only to ask him in a room full of princesses, and why am I dressed like that?â€ (most likely to relieve the tension). -Felis: your typical cat-girl who turns out to be a boy even though he acts, speaks, and looks like a girl. His job is to look cute and help others without interfering with the harem (like the one in Highschool DxD). -Julius: a spirit knight who takes his role very seriously, until he becomes Subaruâ€™s pet and obeys any order he gives him without complaining. -Roswaal Mathers: because the show needs another clown besides Subaru. He acts and speaks like a clown. That's his only unique trait. - Betelgeuse (In English â€œBeetle Juiceâ€): One of the 7 Sin-Archbishop representing Sloth. He reminds me of Nobuyuki Sugou: a one-dimensional, too-evil villain who becomes a joke in the show due to his funny way of speaking and acting. Now for the good elements: â€¢ART & ANIMATION: The art looks really good and is actually nice to look at. The background scenes are noticeable enough and more detailed than usual. The choreographic scenes are fun to watch, others become repetitive but thatâ€™s fine. In conclusion, the art & animation is overall enjoyable. â€¢SOUND: The voice acting was acceptable except for some characters like Bettelgeuse: it was too high-pitched and was a pain to the ears. We get that heâ€™s a villain but trying to make his voice as ugly and insane as he looks is just too much that he eventually becomes some sort of a joke in the show. We look at him and all we see is a Joker-wannabe but with a really annoying voice. Another voice acting that was supposed to be funny became extremely distracting and ruined the whole mood: Roswaal Mathersâ€™ voice. It even makes you question his sexuality. Other voices are good, like Rem & Ram (same voice actress), Emilia, and most male characters. The OP was also great. I never skipped it. Same thing for the ED, except I didnâ€™t listen to it every time. I was too busy trying to figure out the ending. â€¢CONCLUSION: In a nutshell, Re:Zero is an obvious cliched fantasy that tries its best to appeal to the general public. What I mean by that is the typical â€œedgyâ€ cliffhangers, the time-travel, princesses, Knightsâ€¦ the usual), the melodrama (way too much), the harem... Now try imaging a show that has all of those elements and more. No wonder youâ€™ll get a messy, scrambled anime that is not just confusing, but painful to watch. Re:Zero has a tendency to introduce certain characters but later on completely dispose of them as they were mere paper characters. Now the characters are one thing, but take a look at the story line: itâ€™s not linear nor episodic. Itâ€™s lazy and filled with useless and boring arcs. Itâ€™s a whole bunch of stories, like a small book that you read to your child at night: it doesnâ€™t make any sense but itâ€™s a good way to make him fall asleep quickly. â€¢ENJOYMENT: I never enjoyed a single second in this show. Why should I? The story is divided into stories, the main character is pathetic, others were mere fillers and the cliffhangers are always there, whether they make sense or not. Fan service and forced drama win in the end, because thatâ€™s what people want nowadays. Do I recommend this? Well, letâ€™s see: Do you like to watch a bunch of unrelated stories

However, this is all about to change due to the revision of the school's most iconic policy, as boys are now able to enroll as well.  At the start of the first semester under this new decree, a mere five boys have been accepted, effectively splitting the student body into a ratio of two hundred girls to one boy. Kiyoshi, Gakuto, Shingo, Andre, and Jo are quickly cast away without having a chance to make any kind of a first impression. Unable to communicate with their fellow female students, the eager boys set their sights on a far more dangerous task: peeping into the girls' bath!  It's only after their plan is thoroughly decimated by the infamous Underground Student Council that the motley crew find their freedom abruptly taken from them, as they are thrown into the school's prison with the sentence of an entire month as punishment. Thus begins the tale of the boys' harsh lives in Prison School, a righteous struggle that will ultimately test the bonds of friendship and perverted brotherhood.

Living in an alternate-reality Edo, where swords are prohibited and alien overlords have conquered Japan, they try to thrive on doing whatever work they can get their hands on. However, Shinpachi and Kagura still haven't been paid... Does Gin-chan really spend all that cash playing pachinko?  Meanwhile, when Gintoki drunkenly staggers home one night, an alien spaceship crashes nearby. A fatally injured crew member emerges from the ship and gives Gintoki a strange, clock-shaped device, warning him that it is incredibly powerful and must be safeguarded. Mistaking it for his alarm clock, Gintoki proceeds to smash the device the next morning and suddenly discovers that the world outside his apartment has come to a standstill. With Kagura and Shinpachi at his side, he sets off to get the device fixed; though, as usual, nothing is ever that simple for the Yorozuya team.  Filled with tongue-in-cheek humor and moments of heartfelt emotion, Gintama 's third season finds Gintoki and his friends facing both their most hilarious misadventures and most dangerous crises yet.

Unable to experience individual thoughts or emotions, the corpses are programmed by humans to act as laborers in various occupations.  This newfound technology, however, comes with a catch. Science may be able to restore the corpses' ability to move, yet it cannot return what every corpse loses at death: the soul. But Doctor Victor Frankenstein, who vanished shortly after his revolutionary work on corpse reanimation, is said to have revived the only corpse in possession of a soul.  In pursuit of this scientific knowledge, London medical student John Watson hopes to fulfill his promise to his late partner, Friday. After being scouted by a government agency, Watson is on a hunt to obtain Frankenstein's notes, which he believes hold the key to the secrets of the soul. During his search, Watson uncovers the harsh realities of the developing corpse technology and the price he must pay to advance his research.

Not long after arriving however, the girls begin to become overwhelmed with an abnormal sexual desire. No matter what they do to themselves, the lust wonâ€™t go away. They discover that the cause of this is a virus, with the only cure for it being male sperm. Unfortunately, the cure is only temporary and if the lust continues uncontrolled, it results in the host of the virus dying from cardiac arrest.  Now there is quite literally only one man who can save them allâ€”the very same man that they shunned before being stuck on the island.

On the night of August 15th, there was one such farmer woman, but her son loved her, and took her to a mountain to leave her there instead of turning her over to the cruel officers. However, he felt sorry about what he was doing and hid her under the earthen floor of a barn. One day, a messenger of the lord of the neighboring province was sent to the lord of Shinano Province making an unreasonable demand that a silk thread be threaded through a winding hole in a crystal ball and threatened that force would be used unless the task was done. The devoted son consulted with his mother, and she taught him a method in which you put honey around the end of one hole and let an ant tied with a thread go through it from the other end. The lord rewarded the son. However, a messenger was sent from the neighboring province again demanding that they identify which of two identical mares is the parent and which is the child. The son asked his mother again and then told the solution to the lord. When told by the lord that he would grant the sonâ€™s wish, he pleaded for his motherâ€™s life. Since then, old men and women have been treated with respect and are no longer exiled.

Those who chose to settle there unearthed a technology far more advanced than that of their home planet, which they named ""Aldnoah."" This discovery led to the founding of the Vers Empire of Mars and a declaration of war against the ""Terrans,"" those who stayed behind on Earth. However, a battle on the moonâ€”later called ""Heaven's Fall""â€”caused the hypergate to explode, destroying the moon and leading the two planets to establish an uneasy ceasefire.  Their peace was a fragile one, however. Fifteen years later, high school student Inaho Kaizuka witnesses the plotted assassination of the Vers Empire's Princess Asseylum Vers Allusia, who had come to Earth in hopes of repairing the relationship between the empire and its homeland. The ceasefire is shattered, and the Martians declare war on the Terrans once again. In the face of this insurmountable enemy, Inaho and his friends must now fight against the Vers Empire to settle the war once and for all.

Entrusted with the hopes and dreams of this far-off enchanted land, Seiya must now use his many skills to bring Amagi back on its feet, or watch it crumble before his eyes.

When Yamato arrives, it is revealed that the rundown park was where the two of them first talked and bonded for the first time. After bantering a bit, Kai asks Yamato why he, who had always seemed to be having fun with a large crowd around him, was always the first one at the park after school. Yamato admits that he used to feel like he was a chameleon; someone who didn't have his own personality and just changed himself to please others. Kai tells Yamato that he used to hate the town, but thanks to Yamato, he now finds it to be beautiful. Kai reassures him that he is his own person, and Yamato confesses that after he met Mei, he realized just how lonely he was. Kai later runs into Megumi at the bus stop. They start talking, and Kai tells her that he thinks she's cool for staying true to herself while modelling. Megumi snaps back at him, and Kai, offended, leaves.

What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.  After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.

ng ONLY DUELING OBSESSED friend in the beginning. Seriously, the kid had no personality. All that was on his mind was dueling. Nothing else. How did he even have friends? Oh, he left a bigger impact than Yuma. Kotori: The annoying girl and useless ygo main girl, imoï»¿. It's sad when Zexal fans try to defend Kotori. Sure, she's waifu material, but usefulness? Not really, cause she hasn't done much besides cheerleading (the one exception was being able to bring Yuma back his pendant so that he could communicate with Astral against some Barian-brainwashed dude)I love how Kotori fans think theyâ€™re defending HER, when really theyâ€™re just defending the writers sexism. He holed up her own skirt and called Yuma an 'idiot' even worse was that scene with the towel shower scene in 82 i kinda seemd gross-out imo.The unbelievably useless and boring main girl. Since she has some sort of defence squad that pretends sheâ€™s not useless, Iâ€™ll show some partial agreement. Sheâ€™s not 100% useless. Sheâ€™s 98% useless. So at least she had some mild relevance, right? Anyway, as a lover of women, as a girl who craves to end an anime series with a female as my favourite character, I tend to keep my eye on them the most, and defend them when they should be defended, but be critical of them when they need to be criticised, I lean more towards trying to favour the female characters. I could barely find anything good about this girl other than, â€œsheâ€™s sweet and caring and supports Yuma and thatâ€™s about it.â€ To JUST have them? Those are not the qualities of a strong character. As if nobody else was sweet and caring or anything. Emotional support? Some of it. But it was no different to all of his other best friends. This girl has done barely anything and it is just downright embarrassing as the main girl of a series which is full of extremely colourful and strong male characters. Male minor characters do more than she does AND theyâ€™re more interesting as well. I thought one of her best traits in the beginning was that she remained rational when girls were crushing on Yuma but that didnâ€™t last long. Eventually all the girls had jealous bitch fights over him at some point. Her rivalrly with Cathy was pathetic. She doesnâ€™t draw in the audience, but thatâ€™s because Iâ€™ve repeated them over and over in my head as the series went on so that I could at least say SOME good things about her. Unfortunately its not even remotely enough to label her as anything even CLOSE to a strong character. Spamming Utopia with Double or Nothing is the only way for him to win duels and seemed way to predictable. Kaito Tenjo: Worst ygo rival ever. He aintall that great, sure he is strong and visious as most people say he is. However, he aint a real rival, imo. I find Kaito to be really blant and his writing in both shows (ARC-V and Zexal) he leave a little remark and not much.His fans tend to be really annoying and some are aways calling him the best, yet that just seems like it's kinda fake since mostly fans have have thier opinion and etc. During the second half of Zexal, he was butchred poorly and his last duel was kinda bad since the fans never get to see more Photon support - I like how he had cool monsters, I find him overrated in Arc-V and don't get me started on why he is blant. All of the hate for him comes from the people who his character to be really underatted towards new fans. He never duels much after Zexal 1. Meaning his role was compleate and why do people even think he is awesome. He never looses to Yuma and he is pointless to the plot in Zexal 2 and only exists to fight Mizael. And he was just as pointless in Arc-V where he stole Shun a better character's screen time, imo. Even his cameo in Arc-V was total nothingness. Even though his deck is cool... I kinda wanna say this one word. Blant. It sucks cause his VA is a very well known guy and famous for a lot of character roles like in Charlotte, Infinite Stratos, and right now, in Ancient Magus Bride plus HunterxHunter and Beyblade: Shogun Steel. Rio: Her brother was nothing more than motivation fuel after she got killed/sent to the hostipal or put in a coma. What's worst about her has to of bean how poorly writen came to her. True

o suffer the same, but by doing this he has guaranteed that such event will occur multiple times over and over and over. To be completely honest, but I was so very wrongâ€¦ TL;DR [ALfheim arc] There isnâ€™t much to summarize about these dreadful 11 episodes. The ALfheim arc did nothing right and almost everything wrong. It reduces its main female character to nothing but an object to be oversexualized. The new female character which is introduced is only there to be an incredibly awkward love interest for Kirito. There are no significant side characters. It leaves much to be desired in terms of character development and world building just as the Aincrad arc had. This arc has about the same amount of filler, though itâ€™s harder to calculate since the plot is not as concentrated as it had been in the Aincrad arc. The antagonist is horrible, and is arguably worse than Kayaba had been. This arc had literally no redeeming factors. Characters: 2 (Appalling) [Aincrad arc] Kazuto â€œKiritoâ€ Kirigaya. There isnâ€™t much to say about Kirito other than what I have said already, and as you can tell I havenâ€™t gone very deep into Kiritoâ€™s personality but only the show can be blamed for that. Kirito is essentially an empty shell of a person. He rarely shows any kind of believable emotions and is never able to make me care what so ever about what happens to him. He is outrageously OP however, as he can far out level everybody while playing solo which anyone who has ever played an MMO can tell you is complete and utter bullshit, he can take on a group of up to 10 people at once without breaking a sweat, he is also rewarded the ability to be able to dual wield which is a unique ability that only the player with the best reflexes can use and this only makes him even more ridiculously OP, he can hack the game from within the game itself to turn a stupidly advanced AI into an object in the game in just a few seconds, he defies the hard written code of the game to come back to life by the power of boner to kill Heathcliff, he manages to get every girl he meets to like him even though he's an asshole because the show is actually just another terrible romance harem that happens to be set in a VRMMORPG. Heâ€™s a wish-fulfillment character in every sense of the word. Asuna â€œAsunaâ€ Yuuki Asuna is honestly far better than Kirito in terms of showing human emotion as there are some scenes where I actually care about her, but when I say â€œsomeâ€ I really mean 1 out of 10 at most. She is introduced in the second episode as a badass who could possibly even be better than Kirito, but after a few episode she is completely stuck in the â€œKirito-kunâ€ harem and manages to do nothing at all on her own. Yui A minor character who is so unimportant that I didnâ€™t even bother mentioning her. She is beyond annoying and is only there to explain very obvious thing to the audience and to be used as a deus ex machina plot device for the main characters to proceed with the paper thin plot. Kayaba â€œHeathcliffâ€ Akihiko The main villain of the Aincrad arc. There, once again, but theyâ€™re all so insignificant that I canâ€™t even take the time to talk about them. [ALfheim arc] Kazuto â€œKiritoâ€ Kirigaya. There really isnâ€™t a difference between the Kirito we see in the Aincrad arc and the Kirito we see in the ALfheim arc. Heâ€™s just as empty as before, if not more of an idiot in this arc. Asuna â€œAsunaâ€ Yuuki Asuna is basically reduced to nothing in this arc as she is locked up from the get go and isnâ€™t released until the last episode. Sheâ€™s a damsel in distress who is only used for far service from time to time. Suguha â€œLeafaâ€ Kirigaya Suguha is the main love interest for Kirito in this arc. Suguha is also his cousin. See the problem? Had she not been related to Kirito in any way I wouldnâ€™t have a problem with this, and honestly, they didnâ€™t do a very good job at it. Repeating the same threat over and over again without actually doing anything quickly makes those same threats lose their potency. Just like all the other characters in the show, he completely lacks a personality with any particular traits other than being a creepy asshole. Yui Yui hasnâ€™t changed much since the first arc. Sheâ€™s still only there to be convenient to the audience and Kirito to explain what is going on. She is way more annoying in this arc however, since she now almost completely resembles Navi from Legend of Zelda. Art: 7 (Good) I remember how people would tell me Sword Art Online had amazing animation and art, especially in the fights but there isnâ€™t much there to praise. Sure, some of the environments look stunning and some fight scenes are fluid and well-choreographed but everything about the animation screams unoriginality. Itâ€™s as if there is a very specific way a character, place and fight can look in these kinds of action harem light-novel adaptions which makes most of them look very unoriginal. Also, sound track and voice acting except that itâ€™s absolutely phenomenal? Itâ€™s the best part of Sword Art Online by miles and miles. The sound track is beautiful and varied enough not to get repetitive. The sound quality of bare feet on a wooden floor, the clashing of swords as well as something as simple as someone talking off their VR helmet, it all sounds absolutely fantastic and I have to give mad props to whoever is responsible for this. The voice acting is also top-notch. It really is too bad that the characters never said anything at all meaningful. Enjoyment: 1 (Abhorrent) I personally didnâ€™t enjoy anything about Sword Art Online, except for the sound and certain scenes in terms of animation. This

uch!â€ Yes, that makes sense; thank you so much for getting us killed for no reason. Character rewrite once again. Of course they try to present it as if she thanked him for being the only one who gave her courage to keep trying to survive instead of committing suicide or something but that doesnâ€™t fool me. She got killed EXACTLY because he encouraged her and he is supposed to be an anti-social who doesnâ€™t give a ratâ€™s ass. Oh, since she exploits peopleâ€™s lust to have it her way. But no, she is a total dumb girl who doesnâ€™t even know the basic rules of the game. She doesnâ€™t even know of the protagonist, one of the most famous players of the game. And yes, she too falls for him because he exploited her emotions for capturing some bandits and doesnâ€™t miss the chance to offer fan service by constantly flashing her panties and being molested by tentacle monsters. The author is practically only writing about the ideal brothel all video game fans want to spend their lives in and sure as hell does not write good plots or characters. He is exactly like those people who write sappy romances full of sex for bored middle aged housewives. The protagonist is constantly introducing new characters and trying to make them dramatic before killing them or never mentioning them again in the exact same episode. If he wants us to feel sorry for a dying character, he should have kept him around for a dozen episodes so we get to like him first. Or when he is not killing them, he is keeping a few of them around as antagonists, only to conveniently turn them to jerks soon afterwards and the protagonist can seem heroic next to them. I believe the Sword Art Online series is 10 volumes long. One would think this means that the story is very long. And itâ€™s not! Sword Art Online technically lasts only one book! The others are irrelevant side stories that happen in flashbacks or entirely different games! Thatâ€™s right, the title Sword Art Online is practically useless after the first book. Itâ€™s there just so the idiotic fans will keep buying more books with its name on it. Itâ€™s like buying compulsory everything that has an apple on it. This happens because the author used the old â€œBait and Switchâ€ method. Being completely useless to keep a story going for more than a few chapters, yet unwilling to let it finish and move to writing something else, every time an arc ends he just finds a poor excuse to make another arc and start all over again, rehashing the exact same things. After all, Sword Art Online is a light novel, stories written by people with little to no talent, and since the game does a shitty job at explaining its game play, it's clear why this anime is so popular. The protagonist is THE BEST in everything. He has the highest level in the game, the most knowledge of how to farm easy, and can beat the strongest bosses all alone without even being prepared for it. No reason for why he is so good in everything; we are just supposed to accept he is super cool and wish to be like him. Well if you ask me he is completely boring for the same reason. He acts like a Mary Sue who always wins just because of his statistics reaching epic levels without ever showing us how. An overpowered character is a boring character exactly because there is no challenge he canâ€™t overcome. He is also just there to give forceful explanations to how the game works, as if itâ€™s too hard to just show it on screen. And he accomplishes all that by being a complete jerk. He lies, exploits, doesnâ€™t reveal crucial information, leads people to their deaths and every goddamn girl in the game finds out about that and her reaction is to beg him to bang her. Yeah, mister author, where you need to fight hard in order to survive! This is not a game, itâ€™s as real as life itself! â€¦ But at the same time itâ€™s still a game and everybody still acts like it is. Imagine you being the most awesome, most powerful, most smart

When Shigure's lust and fetishes get the better of her, compelling her to please herself in the classroom after class, she had no idea that Komatsu would stumble upon her while cleaning.

 us all to make a very aware and immediate start to public change. All you have to do is be totally open to trusting, accepting responsibility. Looking at it in several and or both ways, self-destructive, moral quandry. Yet boundless, active, and all too deliberate. Hopefully to be progressive movement in spite of ourselves. As long as it's not for the common pitfalls of convenience or someone's else's words in and of themselves. After all nothing hurts more than trying to bridge an inherent gap with others through a conscious effort. Especially when being truly selfless will never be possible due to the walls of our hearts. Even if the end result to any event or outcome is always an open door to something else of your endless choosing or perception. But hey, change in all it's peculiar and ever-widening shapes and sizes should always be fun to step up to the challenge for. So go knock all yourselves out for as long as you can muster. Just make sure to never, ever forget the little lessons and people you struggle with and over in the arduous process. Experience should always be more than just a deep lying, subconscious, alarm clock in time of need. You are more than just a story to be told and remembered. You are a life, never forget the meaning of that. Be willing to sacrifice and better yourselves for everything yet to come. Say what you feel deep down more often (but not too often there dingus). Don't leave hangups, possible loopholes for others, and half assed interactions sole because you felt the need to not give too much away about yourself. Even if it bites you back or hurts those you never would have intended to willingly. Even if you realize that you misunderstood the actual root intention in the first place. Being hurt, hurtful, and mistaken can always lead to a positive purpose if you just think over it enough. We are all one, opposition, or even survival for that matter. More so than any goal, dream, or hope, though of course never leave them entirely on the back burner at any point either. Learn how to calibrate that ever shifting balance. It's that small fraction you see of an aspect of a person. That you thought nothing of at first that has boundless more significance than any plan, life strategy, or set destination ever will. Think in terms of cause and exchange instead of the mere reward of an after effect. One that you'll just try to trudge straight through with all that gutso, pride, and confidence. Life shouldn't be about a damn payoff, epic, or far reaching really. No legacy or historic moment of global shifting. So start graying those precious head hairs. Shedding that ego. Bask in the muddy water and smoldering heat of mundane, drawn out, endless causality of the sun who couldn't give two shits about you. Like I said the beginning and the end are indeed one and the same. One's never any more complete

The country was being torn apart by competing factions - modernizers trying to apply Western technology and ideas to Japanese society; Imperial loyalists, trying to reassert to the ascendancy of the Emperor; and the forces of the Shogunate, trying to defend the military bureaucracy (bakufu) against all comers. The bakufu organized special police squads, notably the Shinsengumi and the Mimawarigumi, to ""defend public order"" and assassinate opponents. (In popular culture, they are all lumped together as the Shinsengumi.) Covert violence and even open warfare were commonplace.  The movie covers 1866 and 1867. It tells the story of a retired samurai, Kumosuke (or Kumo, for short), who is living quietly, not to say idly, in Edo (old Tokyo) with his wife and two children, a young boy named Shinnosuke and an infant girl, Ohana. While he nominally runs a courier business to earn a living, he seems to spend most of his time smoking his pipe, drinking sake, and chasing women. The arrival of a Shinsengumi squad led by a young swordswman, Ichimonji Hyougo, disrupts this peaceful routine. Kumo is forced to use his still-sharp sword skills to defend himself, but he'd basically prefer to stay out of the treacherous political currents. Nonetheless, he ends up saving Ryouma Sakamoto (a famous Westernizer) from the Shinsengumi and teaching Ichimonji the futility of the warrior way.

They take on whatever work they can find while trying not to get involved in anything too dangerous. But when Katsura, the leader of the Joui rebels and Gintoki's long-time acquaintance, disappears after being brutally attacked by an unknown assassin, Shinpachi and Kagura begin an investigation into his whereabouts and the identity of the assailant. Meanwhile, Gintoki takes on a seemingly unrelated job: the blacksmith Tetsuya requests that Gin recover a strange and powerful sword called the Benizakura which was recently stolen.  As the two investigations gradually intersect, the Yorozuya crew find themselves in the midst of a major conspiracy that hinges on the sinister nature of the Benizakura sword. Gintoki resolves to take the fight directly to the enemy headquarters, and together with a few unexpected allies, sets out on one of his most perilous jobs yet.

(Hashire, Melos!), Natsume Sosekiâ€™s Kokoro, Ryunosuke Akutagawaâ€™s Hell Screen (Jigoku Hen) & The Spider's Thread (Kumo no Ito), and Ango Sakaguchi's In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita).  No Longer Human (Ningen Shikkaku) - A high school student becomes lost and alienated. Despondent and aimless, he falls into a cycle of self abuse, depression and drugs that taints his life for years. Told in four chapters, each chapter deals with a different point in his life and the final chapter leaves him standing alone - an empty and hollow caricature of his former self.  In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita) - A love story between a 12th-century woman and a mountain bandit who abducts her.  Kokoro - A 1914 tale of a young man's life journey during the Meiji era. The work deals with the transition from the Japanese Meiji society to the modern era, by exploring the friendship between a young man and an older man he calls ""Sensei"". It continues the theme of isolation developed in Soseki's previous works, here in the context of interwoven strands of egoism and guilt, as opposed to shame.  Run, Melos! (Hashire, Melos!) - An updated retelling of a classic Greek tale of the story of Damon and Phidias. The most prominent theme of ""Run, Melos!"" is unwavering friendship. Despite facing hardships, the protagonist Melos does his best to save his friend's life, and in the end his efforts are rewarded.  The Spider's Thread (Kumo no Ito) - The Buddha Shakyamuni chances to notice a cold-hearted criminal suffering in Hell. But this criminal did perform one single act of kindness in not stepping on a spider in a forest. Moved by this selfless act, Shakyamuni takes the silvery thread of a spider in Paradise and lowers it down into Hell, but it falls upon the criminal to seize the opportunity and pull himself out - if he can.  Hell Screen (Jigoku Hen) - A famous artist is commissioned by a great lord to create a series of paintings depicting scenes of the ""Buddhist Hell."" The artist is unable to paint scenes that he has not seen himself, prompting him to torture and torment the Lord's staff to create his imagined images of hell. His creative efforts taint the household, as the story descends into madness and destruction.

Unfortunately for him, though, he is surrounded by cat lovers: his family, his estranged childhood friend, and even his crush Kaede Mizuno.  One day, while returning home from school, Junpei nonchalantly attempts to kick an empty can into the trash, but miserably misses. Instead of making it to the garbage, the can ends up breaking off the head of a cat deity statue. That fateful day, he is cursed with the ability to understand cat speech. However, he must keep his curse a secret from everyone else, because anyone who finds out will become more accident-prone and share the same fate as him.  With the guidance of his cat Nyamsus and with no other choice left, Junpei now has to do a hundred good deeds for cats to lift the curse. If he is unable to complete this task, he will turn into a cat, and considering his allergy, that would be a death sentence for him!

Usually, the officers of Hekiyou Academy's student council are elected by popular vote, but an additional position is granted to the student who scores the highest on the exams. Ken, who historically has had below average grades, worked hard to improve them to be accepted into the student council, with the ultimate goal of surrounding himself with girls who fawn over him.

But a few minor hurdles like these won't stop Ken from chasing after his dreams, even if they seem a bit ridiculous.

s to fully answer. Early on, when the girls are trying to think of ways to appeal to the new freshmen, â€œwhat is the appeal of our club?,â€ and no one comes up with anything. Itâ€™s important to us as viewers that the name of the show and the name of the club are one and the same, since Tsumugi is literally asking, â€œwhat is the appeal of keion?â€ Later in the episode, Ui asks Yui the same question, and Yui answers that, â€œitâ€™s just fun.â€ The fact that this answer comes first, and that it isnâ€™t the last answer weâ€™ll be given in the course of this arc, is imperative. On the most basic level, K-On is indeed fun. If you asked a lot of the showâ€™s fans what the appeal is, theyâ€™ll probably give you the exact same answer, and thatâ€™s fine. But the show is as interested in diving a little bit deeper into that as I am. What episode eight mostly serves to show us is how strange and insular the light music club has gotten to be over the first year of its existence. The personality quirks which the four girls and their teacher all take for granted end up alienating the new freshmen, who see them as a weird and incomprehensible little clique. And theyâ€™re basically right to think thatâ€“it would be incredibly hard to break into a group this tightly-knit. But when Azusa sees the group performing on stage, even if she doesnâ€™t understand yet what the cause of that energy is. Episode nine is our proper introduction to the fifth band member, Nakano Azusa, Azusa is a serious guitarist who wants to be in a serious band, and most of the episode is about her trying to reconcile the awesome performance that the light music club put on at the freshman welcoming ceremony against the unmotivated idiots that they seem to be. This episode is almost uncomfortable to watch, as it comically plays up all of the charactersâ€™ worst attributesâ€“and once again, itâ€™s doing that on purpose. At this point, weâ€™ve gotten used to the rhythm of the main groupâ€™s interactions; but this episode seeks to show us how off-putting and uncomfortable it would be as a newly inducted outsider. We feel Azusaâ€™s frustration and anger not only at the group for slacking off so much, but at herself for admiring them in spite of it all. Azusa makes us feel guilty for having gotten used to the way these characters act, by reminding us how dumb they can really be. Yet along the way, she looks at other bands and just doesnâ€™t see in them what she saw in the clubâ€™s performance, so she seeks answers from Mio as the only seemingly sane member of the group. Remember, back in episode four, Mio was the first one to get frustrated with the clubâ€™s lack of ambition

The audience is expected to be enamored with this vehicle. At one scene when it looks like the tank is sure to get away, the background music turns into cocktail-lounge jazz and sparkly lights swirl around the tank. The tank carries six ATGM launchers (which Ken is somehow able to dislodge with minimal trouble, along with a piece of the turret, towards the end of the movie), three to each side of the turret, and a laser-based machine-gun-esque installment, in addition to its rifled main gun. The tank's treads are dual-mounted (the tread is split in half, making four sets of treads for the tank).  The employment of the laser, however, seems counter-productive to a machine-gun's mission, as it can only fire once every few seconds. If it can fire at higher rates, it does not do so, and tries to acquire a lock on its pursuer (Blader, in this case). This suggests a low ammunition capacity, unlike thousand-round-and-up machine-guns routinely mounted on modern tanks. It does not appear to have any effect on the road, either, which does not say much about its power.  Another tank involved is the MBT-90D, which are dispatched by the Army (or Air Forceâ€”the movie never makes it clear if it is a joint effort, although the general who arrives midway into the movie is shown riding in something resembling an ADATS) to take out the tank. Despite having at least a platoon of these, the MBT-99 still evades capture. The M-90Ds are armed with a three-barreled autocannon, the calibre of which may be around fifteen to twenty millimeters. The MBT-90D is equipped with three ATGM missile launchers, on the left side of the turret, and its main cannon is mounted on the front, instead of on a turret.  After the MBT-99's hijackers (who appear inside the tank after getting away from a recently-committed bank robbery), hired by a shadowy group, backed by a foreign nation seeking an edge in their military (the M-99 is presumably on its way to be tested at a separate base), are forced out by Ken and his team, Eleanor enters to study the tank, and it starts up on its own, having been programmed by the hijackers to head for a pier and drive off its end so as to rendezvous with an enemy submarine. The rest of the movie is made up of the chase through the city, resulting in the destruction of another bank (owned by the same corporation that built the first bank in the movie), and various collateral damage.",5.73,207,PG-13 - Teens 13 or older,#7828,#9251,1,535,1,Movie,Original,N/A,Finished Airing,Studio_Nue (199),,,1 hr. 20 min.,,,,,,,

Due to the fact that pollution was becoming a major problem, scientists had developed the use of hydrogen fuel called ""HBT"" as an alternative to fossil fuels. At this time humans have colonized Mars in search of new place to call home as a result of overpopulation. In the year 2050, a mysterious alien race called the Inbit invaded the Earth. Unable to fight the Inbits, Earth became desolate with only a few pockets of human beings scattered throughout the planet. Many of the refugees escape aboard a few remaining shuttles to seek shelter on the Moon. The Inbit sets up their main base of operations in the Great Lakes area of North America called ""Reflex Point"".    However, the Mars colony, dubbed the Mars Base, did not forget about the plight of Earth. Troops were sent in to fight the Inbits from the Moon, only to fail miserably. The Inbits did not attack Mars, and showed no interest towards the other planets. Surprisingly the Inbit show no hostility towards humans unless they are directly provoked. The Inbit can also sense the presence of HBT, and use of the fuel is limited under their supervision, as HBT is a common component in weapons technology. Overnight the Mars base becomes a gigantic military machine, producing vast amounts of advanced weaponry and trained troops. In 2080, Mars Base sent in the next wave of troops. Although equipped with more technologically advanced equipment and transformable mecha, the attempt to recapture the homeworld was nonetheless a failure.  Three years later, Mars Base launched another attack called the Second Earth Recapture Force. One of the troops happened to be Lieutenant Stick Bernard (Also called Stig Bernard by some, the original english dub before Robotech used Stick). The mission proved to be unsuccessful as it did three years ago and Stick's fiancÃ©e Marlene was killed. After losing her, Stick was forced to crash into Earth, landing in South America. At first, he was sorrowful and depressed at the death of his beloved Marlene. After seeing the holographic recording of his dead betrothed, Stick swore an oath of vengeance. In his quest to reach the Reflex Point on North America, the Inbit 'hive', he meets other characters of the show, forming a group of ragtag freedom fighters on a goal to rid the planet of the Inbits.  As the plot unravels, the purpose of the Inbits invasion is revealed. Their sole purpose of coming to the planet was because Earth provides them a suitable place to evolve into more complex beings. However, little did the Inbits know that their endeavor actually threatens to cause the extinction of both humans and Inbits. And thus, it is up to Stick and his group, with the help of human-like Inbits (Aisha and Solzie), to convince the supreme ruler of the Inbit, the Refles, to flee from Earth. MOSPEADA stands for Military Operation Soldier Protect Emergency Aviation Dive Auto, one of the transformable motorcycle-armors the series features. The other primary mecha featured in the show is the three-form transformable fighter called the Armo-Fighter AFC-01 Legioss, which is very much similar to the VF-1 Valkyrie variable fighter in The Super Dimension Fortress Macross.

Alien invaders known as the Neuroi came to Earth in 1939. This is not the first appearance of the Neuroi as they have appeared at seemingly random intervals throughout human history. While the Neuroi primarily attack humanity using aircrafts, their mothership is able to produce a deadly miasma, a chemical that is fatally poisonous to humans, forcing the populations of affected areas to flee their homes. The Neuroi then use the poisoned areas to plunder Earth's natural resources to use against humanity. Luckily the miasma cannot spread across water, making the ocean humanity's main line of defense against the Neuroi.  With normal humans unable to fight in the miasma, witches have become the forefront of military defense against the Neuroi. Each witch is able to deploy a defensive field around themselves that not only blocks the miasma but protects them from physical attacks as well. Utilizing leg mounted machines called Striker Units to fly into combat, the witches use their magical abilities to wield devastating weapons too large and ungainly for a normal person. The series follows the battles fought by the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, who battle on the front lines to defend the British Isles from the Neuroi.

Near the epicenter of the activity, the expedition discovers vast land markings akin to the Nazca paleoglyphs drawn in the Peruvian desert. Stranger still is the presence of an enormous underground cavern below these symbols. At the bottom of the chasm, a portion of a tremendous tower juts from the ground. Armed with ultra-digital cameras, the scientific team transmits their findings to the Command Center. One explorer traces the image of a star chart engraved on the tower's exterior. The tower begins to emit a sinister howling as if possessed by demonic forces. One by one, the members of the expedition writhe in pain and die. Those observing the scene at the Command Center watch helplessly. As the high-frequency noise suffuses their headquarters, they too succumb and die in agony. When the waves of the frequency are analyzed, they are discovered to be a beacon directed at the planet Elysium, which lies beyond Earth's solar system.  Van, the reluctant hero of the story, is an 18-year-old pizza delivery boy in Manhattan. He competes in the most popular sport of the 22nd century -- turbo jai alai racing. These races are fast paced and deadly affairs that integrate virtual reality into the competition. He's deeply in love with Lydia, a talented ballerina. In the chaotic futuristic metropolis, they only have each other and their dreams. Van and Lydia desperately want the chance to escape the polluted city-scape. Despite the dangers, Van enters a turbo jai alai race in the hopes of winning first prize -- two tickets to a galactic resort where Lydia can audition for the Jupiter Ballet.  Meanwhile, earth's deep space observation vessel, the Odyssey, patrols the planet's orbital perimeter. The Odyssey is confronted by an armada of sophisticated alien spacecraft from Elysium. The awed human crew prepares to receive the Elysian ambassador, Yaspe. Without warning, the Odyssey loses control of its weapons, fires on the ambassador's vessel and destroys it. This tragic misunderstanding results in brutal retaliation by the Elysian fleet, culminating in the destruction of the Odyssey and a full-scale attack on Earth.  Van's deadly sport of choice turns deadlier when the stadium he is competing in comes under fire from the Elysian barrage. Van struggles through the chaos on his turbo-cycle to rescue Lydia from the collapsing stands. The indiscriminate Elysian onslaught scorches cities worldwide. Van and Lydia flee through the burning streets of Manhattan seeking safety. After a series of harrowing escapes, they find refuge in a claustrophobic fall-out shelter.

me of the dumbest episodes of this season (namely 40 and 46) really lost me, in some cases, R2 doesn't have the same charm as season 1,  and I felt a bit more worried overall, even if the humor is on point once again. It can be a lot more frustrating this time around with some of the aforementioned episodes, but overall, it's still a very entertaining ride. Maybe I'm too biased in my enjoyment of this series given all its problems? I dunno. Maybe I shouldn't have enjoyed this as much as I did, even if I don't enjoy it nearly as much as R1, but hey, c'est la vie, am I right? OVERALL: 7/10    RAW SCORE: 74/100 This season is definitely a downgrade from the first season in some of the more essential accounts. While the OST is god-tier and some of the best characters from season 1 only grew better, some of the logic in this show falls unbelievably flat, and some of the new guys don't hold a candle in comparison to the returning characters. Plus, the bad CGI is more rampant. I cannot say that I truly love this season (at least, not nearly as much as I used to), however it was still entertaining, ambitious, season 1 is definitely better and I can only dream of what could have been.

The manga on which it is based is one of the much-read works produced for adolescent Japanese girls that features a healthy proportion of gay men and beautiful teenagers aka bishounen (beautiful boys). Most of the action takes place in Marinera, the land of eternal spring, located somewhere in the South Seas. The country is a major producer of diamonds; they provide much of the basis of conflict in the anime series. They come from one of the most prolific mines in the world, owned by the king of Marinera, the vertically challenged but horizontally endowed boy-king Patarillo himself. The International Diamond Syndicate - a huge semi- criminal organization/ secret society dedicated to taking over the world`s entire diamond supply- wants that mine and will stop at nothing to get it. In the early episodes they send off a number of bishounen assassins to do in Patarillo, which necessitates his having a bodyguard, the English MI6 agent, Major Jack (`Bishounen-Killer`) Bancoran. Bancoran`s nickname doesn`t mean he shoots bishounen in cold blood. The soubriquet comes from the fact that no male under the age of 17 can resist his sexual fascination. This, to Bancoran`s eternal disgust, includes Patarillo himself. The action switches often from Marinera to MI6 headquarters in London (London seems to be an easy two hour`s flight from the South Seas) or Bancoran`s palatial condo in the suburbs of same. (MI6, be it noted, looks a lot like Fritz Lang`s Metropolis, while Jack`s `apartment` bears a passing resemblance to Randolph Hearst`s spread.) The action also goes into the past and future and out into space. Patarillo evidently gets around.

The story gets its roots from the actual street racing that occurs on Tokyo's Shuto Expressway, one stretch of which is known as the ""Wangan"", literally meaning ""bay side"" (although it is generally used to refer to the freeway), the longest, straightest road in the entire country. Of course, there's also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines.  One day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z (Z31) and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 964 Turbo (nicknamed the ""BlackBird""). With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car's previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner's death. The manga follows Akio's various encounters, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for superiority.

Pinocchio (Mokku) is characterized as having many character faults which he must learn to overcome in order to be worthy of being granted humanity. Some of these character faults include selfishness, rudeness, insensitivity, indolence, obstinacy, over- trusting, self-pity, stupidity, disobedience, compulsive lying, arrogance, greed, cowardice, recklessness, cruelty, foolishness and an inability to learn from mistakes.  Throughout the entire series Pinocchio (Mokku), partly due to his own delinquency and repetitive disobedience, must undergo other costly ordeals of hardship and pain in which he is continuously tormented, persecuted, bullied, humiliated, tricked, ridiculed, ostracised, beaten, downtrodden and subjected to degrading and inhumane treatment. Its plain depiction of the austere reality of what it would be like to be literally subhuman growing up in a world of danger and hardship, makes this another good example of traditional Japanese stories, which teach moral observance through tough endurance.

2552,Tetsuko no Tabi,https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/11/3270.jpg,Comedy (4) | Seinen (42) | Slice_of_Life (36),"Based on a seinen manga by Kikuchi Naoe and Yokomi Hirohiko, serialised in IKKI.  The ""story"" is that a manga artist is asked by her boss to accompany him and a travel-writer on various train trips around Japan and draw a manga about it.  The kicker though, is that it's completely non-fiction â€”the creator really did go on all these trips, and the manga simply records what happened, with no embellishment. There's a little disclaimer at the front that says ""This is non-fiction, so I apologize for the lack of drama,"" and indeed, it mostly is just about them riding trains from place to place, waiting on platforms, etc.  The ""travel writer"" turns out to be a super train-otaku who has vast knowledge of the train network, but also micro-manages all their trips, planning every detail down to the second. He cares mostly about following the schedule and successfully achieving his planned goals (e.g. visiting all stations on a line in a completely bizarre order to accomodate infrequent trains). The mangaka doesn't really care about trains; she's cynical, sarcastic, and rather lazy (she mainly just looks forward to the next eki-ben); he's completely gung-ho as long as he's following the schedule, and the inevitable conflicts are pretty entertaining.  Throughout, though, it feels real â€”if you've travelled by train in Japan it will all seem very familiar, not just the scenery, but also the atmosphere and feelâ€” and the artist does a great job of pacing and applying little tweaks to keep it consistently entertaining. In an additional bit of recursiveness, some of the characters who show up in the manga (who of course are real people, who really did show up) do so because they (really) read previous episodes of the manga!  In addition of course, you can learn about various out of the way and interesting Japanese train lines and stations; some of them really do look cool. There's always this vague sense of surreality about it however, the trips are all planned by the train-guy (goal: visit all 9,843 stations in Japan) who seems to consider everything as part of a checklist rather than an experience to be enjoyed. You learn a bit about train-otaku culture too; there's really only the one guy in the story, but train-otaku culture is a sort of constant peripheral presence.

Several centuries ago in Nottingham County, a cruel and greedy baron by the name of Alwine ordered the destruction of the Huntingtons' castleâ€”from the fire of which Robin and his cousins, Will, Winifred and Barbara, miraculously escaped. The youngsters sought shelter in Sherwood Forest, where, thanks to the wise guidance of the hermit better known as ""Friar Tuck,"" they managed to face the difficulties of a life in the wilderness as as well as they could; however, in the forest there lived a fearless group of young bandits, led by Little John. Their first encounter with Robin and his cousins was at first rather stormy, as the two groups fought for the destiny of a young, noble maiden named Marian who had fallen into the hands of the bandits during an ambush.  Their bitterness, however, rapidly lead the way to friendship, and Robin and John later realized they were all victims of the same fate. The youngsters thus mutually decided to help one another. Baron Alwine was not merely enemy of the Huntingtonsâ€”in fact, a couple years earlier he had forced Little John and his gang to seek protection in the forest to avoid forced labour. He would later seek Marian Lancaster for the secret carved on a cross the girl wore as symbol of her family line.  The girl was to be adopted by the shady Bishop Herfortâ€”Alwine's accompliceâ€”who sought to attain the Lancaster's wealth. With all their strength, Robin and his friends were then compelled to fight against the baron's troops, led by Gilbertâ€”a dangerous and fearless knight. When Winifred and Marian were then imprisoned in the castle's dungeons, our heroes tried in every way possible to enter until their ardour was finally rewarded with success. Thanks to his noble heart and heed for danger, Robin became rapidly known as the protector of the poor and oppressed.

The first deals with a group of young women who, after being out of school for a few years, are beginning to think about settling down. However, there is one member of the group who has no prospects, and Shizuka's friends are worried that her shyness will keep Mr. Right from noticing her beauty and character.  They persuade her to join a dating service called The Wedding Club, but when her first match seems to be quite a dud, Shizuka wonders if a trip down the isle just isn't in her future. The second episode is about five sisters, only one of whom isn't married. What's more, the cool Kiyomi seems to have no interest whatsoever in finding a husband. Her sisters have other ideas, though, and when a co-worker asks her out on a date, the women convince the suitor to propose marriage that very night.This is easier said than done, however, as Kiyomi's attitude can be quite intimidating.  The young man may not end up following through with the plan, but even if he does there is no guarantee that the headstrong lady in question will say yes.

Furthermore, another massive earthquake hit Japan on August 15, splitting the country into two. While Japanese refugees were taken in by various countries, the Japanese government accepted aid from China and the United States, which eventually caused China to govern the North, and the USA to govern the South. 15 years later, the Japanese refugees residing in Taiwan and the Taiwanese citizens find themselves clashing with one another, due to job competition and the unimproving conditions of the Japanese refugees. Genichiro Ryu is a survivor of the catastrophic events that took place in Japan, but was raised in Taiwan by a couple who adopted him.

As it seems, the special was finished before Ruby-Spears decided to redo their whole show with a completely new design, better suited for American audiences.  Thus, not fitting the new style anymore, it never was included in the series.

It's unknown if these 3 Episodes ever saw an official release, until 2002, when Capcom of Japan decided to finally (re)release them on DVD for Rockman's 15th Anniversary (all featuring a Japanese and English dub, but no subs).

There is just one thing that stands in his wayâ€”everyone else in the world! Though the Number One can only be challenged by the Number Two, the Number Two can be challenged by anyone.

When the first year students are required to perform a summoning ritual, Louise's summoning results in a catastrophic explosion!

See how their relationship is mostly artificial with no real weight? â€¢	That is the most underwhelming invasion I have seen. One ship? Kiddingz me? â€¢	That outfit the princess is wearing seems pretty impractical. What is she going to do? Seduce her enemies to death (which to be fair might not be the worst planâ€¦)? â€¢	OK I thought the invading parties numbers where underwhelming but the defending side is a joke. How am I supposed to take this war seriously? Also why the fuck is bitch there? She canâ€™t possible defend herself against trained soldiers. Wonâ€™t she be a massive liability? â€¢	Why is blond rose guy still in his uniform? This show is retarded. â€¢	I have no more yoke to give. I donâ€™t understand anymore. The impracticability of both flying a plane and using his sword at the same time. â€¢	Where are the defending sidesâ€™ mages? Donâ€™t they have any? Why is just Tony a problem? â€¢	Even more retarded stuff. Why doesnâ€™t she make a new golem? Why was she not burned to deaths since she was covered in the oil? â€¢	Ward-sama has map awareness of a potato. Isnâ€™t this guy to be an elite fighter? Why didnâ€™t he see that dragon attack coming from a mile away? â€¢	Of course Loiuse happens to be super op and have the most broken magic in the world. How interesting. See this is just boring since we know that itâ€™s just bound to work with no consequence. â€¢	Did bitch just mass murder everyone on the opposing side?

FUCK OFF! You lying piece of shit. I guess this is just a middle finger to your family huh? â€œO sorry guys Iâ€™d rather flirt with a bunch of girls than be with my familyâ€. Our fucking hero, what a guy! â€¢	ClichÃ© villain is beaten just like that. What an ending you know. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Since I have a lot to conclude I will divide the conclusion into multiple sections. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So this is where most of the problems lie in this show. A decent show at least depends on characters that are likable and this show has no likable characters. I will deconstruct the ones that matter and give my opinion on how they can be improved. Saito - This is possible the worst character of this show... or of any show. He fails even the most basic traits of a good character. He is not relatable in any way having basically zero charisma, flirts around with a bunch of women even though he likes Louise and she likes him back, indecisive, rushes head first without thinking about it, etc. He also doesn't care much about his family which he basically never mentions and never feel homesick yet always makes the claim that he wants to return home. Not only is this a contradiction but it makes him come a across as a heartless asshole. What the writers could have done IMO is have him talk a little bit about his family. This would not only make him come across as a more likeable and relateable guy but actually proves that he wants to go back home. Louise - Her character is just a complete and utter mess. I don't like the tsundere archetype since these people don't actually exist in real life so its hard to relate to them however if character development/history is explored and developed enough then that is perfectly acceptable. Her tsundere ways are, however, not even remotely explained so she just comes across as a crazy bitch. Had the writer just been bothered to give even a small explanation then her character might have been bearable. And personally I would have toned down the crazy a bit. No other characters are worth talking about since they are just 1-D cardboard cutouts. My overall score for characters is 1/10. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The story is abysmal if you can even call it a story. The structure and flow and completely nonsensical. It basically does its own thing when it likes and how it likes it. Since I cant describe the story much beyond the synopsis because it is so random I will not bother. Instead I talk about how how the story could be improved. For one the story could actually have a sense of direction by using, for example, the goal of the protagonist to get home and his journey. It can also explain some of the themes its premise presented like social classes and mage rankings. You could also have that conflicting theme between choosing the people you have come to love in one world over the people you love in another. You also could have a had a theme on how difficult it is to adapt to a new setting when you are so used to an old one and how those people around you can help you. It also could have had a theme of what is more important in this world: being human or familiar? (taken from episode nine). By using these the story could be great! Story gets a 1/10 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Animation, art-style, sound, acting and all that jazz --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Honestly all of this stuff was alright but not great. The animation was alright apart from the fights which where just very unimpressive and uninspired. The art was kinda OK. Backgrounds where actually pretty decent  but character designs where mediocre. Saito's in particular was bad," just being very bland and generic just like his character. At least SAO had amazing visuals to make up for its awful writing. Sound was decent. That is all. Voice acting was also decent. No one stood in particular but no one was bad. Overall: 5.5 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My enjoyments/final thoughts --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Alright so I hated this anime but at the same time I also quite enjoyed it. Yup. It was fun ripping it apart and being honest I can kinda maybe understand if someone liked this. Enjoyment gets a 7/10 The main reason I rate the show so low is because of the potential it hard to better than the average with its intriguing setting and possibilities. But because it failed it has made me sad and mad. The show gets a 1/7. WOULD NOT WATCH EVER AGAIN!!!!!!""",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

t facile : Satou est humain. Tout Ã§a pour Ã§a ? Ouais, tout Ã§a pour Ã§a. Ce n'est pas qu'il n'Ã©tait pas humain au dÃ©but de la sÃ©rie, ce n'est pas non plus qu'il cesse de l'Ãªtre Ã  la fin de la sÃ©rie â€“ quoique sa condition se soit amÃ©liorÃ©e â€“ mais plutÃ´t qu'on cesse de le voir Ã  travers ce filtre qui semblait avoir Ã©tÃ© trop parfaitement taillÃ© pour lui. Satou dit qu'il est un hikikomori. Misaki le Â« prend en charge Â» parce qu'il est un hikikomori (pour en tirer profit sur le long terme). Yamazaki est rÃ©voltÃ© par sa condition de hikikomori et passe le plus clair de son temps Ã  lui remonter les bretelles et lui donner des trucs Ã  faire. Hitomi aussi tire profit de sa situation pour l'attirer avec elle dans une Â« mission suicide Â». Megumi va jusqu'Ã  renouer contact avec lui parce qu'il est un hikikomori pour l'attirer dans une arnaque. Seulement toutes ces pÃ©ripÃ©ties nous ont montrÃ© la distance qu'il existe entre l'Ã©tiquette et celui qui la porte â€“ contre son grÃ© ou non. Satou lui-mÃªme invoque ce statut quand Ã§a l'arrange ; s'il refuse de sortir de chez lui pour affronter ses responsabilitÃ©s il n'a qu'Ã  s'en dÃ©charger en se criant Ã  lui-mÃªme : Â« Ha ! Il n'y a aucune chance pour qu'un hikikomori sorte de chez lui deux jours d'affilÃ©e ! Â». Lorsque les personnages s'Ã©tonnent de ses faits et gestes, eux-mÃªme ont plus ou moins cette formulation : Â« un hikikomori n'est pas censÃ© faire Ã§a Â» (par exemple lorsque Satou se met Ã  sortir naturellement de chez lui sans se rendre compte que c'est anormal). Ã€ l'image de Yamazaki balanÃ§ant en fin de sÃ©rie une de ses vacheries habituelles : Â« Tu oublie que tu es un hikikomori. Il est impossible qu'un hikikomori sorte pour vendre des trucs Â». C'est le serpent qui se mord la queue, les proches de Satou qui le recadrent sans s'en rendre compte dans cette catÃ©gorie mortifÃ¨re dont il s'Ã©tait enfin momentanÃ©ment Ã©chappÃ©. Enfin voilÃ , le 24Ã¨me Ã©pisode est fini, maintenant plus personne n'est dupe (je l'espÃ¨re) : un hikikomori c'est une faÃ§ade. DerriÃ¨re laquelle Satou s'abrite lorsqu'il doit justifier son inactivitÃ©, et dont les autres se saisissent pour en faire ce qu'ils veulent. Un hikikomori, c'est un point de repÃ¨re qu'exige la sociÃ©tÃ© nippone pour mettre dans une case ceux qui ne peuvent se rÃ©soudre Ã  entrer dans les autres. Pour certains, ce que je viens d'Ã©crire sonnera sans doute comme une banalitÃ© Ã©hontÃ©e, mais vu la maniÃ¨re dont en traite la sÃ©rie c'est avec plaisir que j'insiste dessus. Bon, si on fait abstraction du terme, il est quoi finalement Satou ? Eh bien en bon protagoniste, il est confus. Le mot est lancÃ©. Il paraÃ®t simpliste lui aussi, mais pourtant si on cherche le plus petit dÃ©nominateur commun au comportement erratique de Satou, de la moindre de ses actions, du moindre de ses sentiments. Satou n'a aucune idÃ©e de ce qui l'anime dans la vie, par exemple. Et le plus facile, pour ne pas avoir Ã  affronter toutes les questions existentielles et pratiques que notre monde a Ã  offrir, c'est encore de rester cloÃ®trÃ© en soi et de garder tout Ã  l'extÃ©rieur. L'isolement de Satou dans son appartement n'est qu'une mÃ©taphore de ses luttes intÃ©rieures. Il n'a pas peur du soleil, ou de la foule, enfin pas rÃ©ellement, il a surtout peur de se confronter au regard des autres ; Ã  force de repousser l'inÃ©vitable, de se frayer une place de plus en plus rÃ©duite au milieu des sacs poubelles symbolisant ses responsabilitÃ©s laissÃ©es en plan, photographier des Ã©coliÃ¨res Ã  la sortie du collÃ¨ge, bosser sur un scÃ©nario de jeu, partir en voyage, s'enfoncer dans un jeu en ligne... Parce qu'elles sont dictÃ©es par la nÃ©cessitÃ© vitale d'occuper son cerveau et son corps tandis qu'il Ã©vite d'avoir Ã  se pencher sur sa vie

Thanks to some outrageous miracle, the Shadow Angels went dormant, and humanity was able to live another 12,000 years without fearing their presence. But 11 years after a catastrophe dubbed the Holy Genesis brought ruin to the Earth, the Shadow Angels were stirred from their slumber and resumed the attacks once more.  To give humanity somewhat of a chance, an organization known as DEAVA was formed, and use of a robotic weapon named Aquarion has been authorized. In order for the Aquarion to be brought to full power, three pilots must combine their hearts, bodies, and souls into oneâ€”a feat few can hope to accomplish. Thus, the search for so-called 'Element Users' was prioritised, hoping to ensure humanity's future.

By the 24th century, humans have found a way to colonize the previously uninhabitable planet. As futuristic as that sounds, Neo Venezia is still teeming with rustic beauty; gondolas on wide canals and waterways are the main mode of transportation. The city itself is a faithful replication of Manhome's (the planet formerly known as Earth) Venice.  To make sure that residents and tourists alike get the most from Neo Venezia's many wonders, companies offering guided tours via gondola were formed, one of which is named Aria Company.  This is the workplace of Akari Mizunashi, a free spirited teenager from Manhome who is now a novice Undine (the title given to tour guides). Join Akari as she becomes intimately acquainted with other Undine, tourists, Neo Venezia's residents, and even the city itself, learning many valuable life lessons along the way, such as the wonderful truth that there are such things as manmade miracles.

tâ€™s what a hero does. Help others and put those people before themselves. Anyways, the charm shines as usual, you should be well acquainted with the way this show tells individual stories. So hopefully you wonâ€™t stumble upon this episode and suddenly realize that it operates one little story at a time, and this really isnâ€™t a change of pace other than both how it focuses on President Aria and how itâ€™s divided into two stories. EPISODE NINE â€œIf you have to get old, then I want to be a wonderful old person. (how insightful) Now matter how old I get, Iâ€™ll be the nice sort of old lady that everyone admires!â€ â€œIf thatâ€™s your dream, does that mean itâ€™s okay if people donâ€™t admire you now? Youâ€™ll be fine, Aika. Even if no one looks up to you now, Iâ€™m sure one day, uhâ€¦ Hmmâ€¦â€ Akari tells Ai that it has become autumn, and the change of colors for the leaves on trees makes for a beautiful scene. Nine episodes in, it feels like I already got to see so much of Aqua, and the change of scenery provided by the seasons really adds more to that sum total. Viewing this same change and realizing time is passing quickly, the Undines become inspired to get more serious with their training, continuing to push forward. This episode features a near-existential crisis from Aika, who happens to be the original founder of Aria Company. The trio ventures from Neo-Venezia by train to go find the esteemed gondolier. When they meet the lady, they are very excited to meet her, and Aika humorously finds a way to assume them to be more than that. However, in the end, the only lesson Grandma has for the three young Undines is for them to take in all the rough moments in life and allow it to change themselves. Taking all troubles in with the happier moments, allowing your love for the world and everyone entirely to shine in your work, will therefore benefit you and those nearby. This very simple concept speaks miles of truth. Nobodyâ€™s outlook on the world is entirely based on only their good or only their bad experiences. To let only the good change you is to eliminate potentially a major part of who you are. EPISODE TEN â€œAkari, letâ€™s go to a hot spring! A hot spring!â€ â€œA hot spring?â€ â€œItâ€™s a big bath, like the size of a pool.â€ â€œWe can invite Alicia too!â€ Aqua is reaching winter. Itâ€™s certainly going to get more and more difficult to scull a gondola, insects Alicia says appear once winter is on the fringe. They live under ash tree leaves in the spring, and they move to white fir roots in the summer. Then when it starts getting really cold, they come out briefly and signal the coming of winter. Details like this really help me to believe this planet is actually in a legitimate state of transition like the world really is alive. A particular snowbug becomes attached to Akari, following her around almost to give her a long welcome to Aquaâ€™s winter. The cold season is arguably the most visually distinct of the four

In a certain school, there was once a fun club centered around magic but had turned into murder and a lust for power. Sealed and willfully forgotten, the resulting evil of that day remained chained in the school's basement. Twelve years later, high school student Taki Minase, while inspecting the place where the incident took place, uncloaks the secret plastered in bloodâ€”a book of magic called ""Black Bible."" Trying his luck with its love curses, he soon finds out the magic proves real and easily penetrates the hearts and bodies of his fellow classmates.  The resulting intercourse leaves the student body very vocal, and Minase's acts do not go unnoticed. What was at first a simple stroke of curiosity becomes much larger and harder to control. Fully swallowed by the unshackled darkness, everyone he knows becomes a victim, including his childhood friend Kurumi Imari. Torn apart, Minase finally realizes his mistakes and that he must reverse them in time if he ever hopes for him and Imari to come together.

r alongside the rest of the Ojamajos. We see that initially, Momoko is seen as a foreign figure in the eyes of Hana, as well as maturating her as a person who is capable of moving on from grief. What comes with moving on and letting go of your past is the discipline in shaping your future and, in Momokoâ€™s case, this is exhibited by Majo Monroe herself. Momo must move on, but moving on is for naught if you were to forget your previous experiences, and episode 47 of â€˜Dokkaanâ€™ defines this while grounding the notion of your family coming before your friends. This keen sense of maturity is depicted numerous times in Ojamajo Doremi, but what may be the most significant is episode 17 of â€˜Dokkaanâ€™, detailing the psychology of a particular child who feels that he wonâ€™t accomplish anything special in his life. The imagery of flight is especially prevalent here; and itâ€™s treated as a connection to Momokoâ€™s situation as well as foreshadow her future departing later on in the series. She speaks of the â€˜invisible wings on the backs of childrenâ€™ as well as the phrase â€˜Stay Goldâ€™, meaning that â€˜All good things must endâ€™. These remarks are used as the overarching morals of the episode in addition to the designating statements which Momokoâ€™s character adheres to: she defines â€˜coming of ageâ€™, one that all of the other children can relate to. Onpu Segawa acts as an intermediate between Aiko and Momoko while also sharing a situation similar to that of Hadzukiâ€™s; she wants to establish a greater connection with her parents, as she feels separated from them within her own household, one that is affluent due to the growing success of her career. Onpuâ€™s father is a rather enigmatic man, and while he loves his daughter dearly, due to his line of work as a train conductor he is unable to display this affection. Similarly, but for vastly different reasons: being a former idol herself, Onpuâ€™s mother spends most of her time organising her daughterâ€™s career; her previous failings as an idol results in her forcing her only daughter down the path she was unable to walk. While it is clear that Onpu is pressured to continue working as a child idol, Onpu understood the necessary vigour one must have while supporting others; which is precisely what being an idol is all about. Ojamajo Doremi Na-i-sho episode 4 examines a different aspect of being involved in the idol industry while still staying true to the daunting task of supporting your fans and family; the altering identity that comes with it. This episode is a meditative insight into Onpuâ€™s reflection on her past, including how she was like as a child, how she has changed since then and what motivates her to continue working. Traveling back to the origin of her incentive, we are served with a comparative outlook on her growth, acting as a coming-of-age to symbolise how Onpu has reached a state of maturity akin to that of adulthood; the reflection of her history shrouded in a mist of nostalgia of days long gone. Calling back to Momokoâ€™s commemoration of her past, Onpu too apprehends the meaning of maturation as she now, after figuring out the transition in herself as well as her affection to her parents, however, what makes this distinct, is the focus towards her impending future. Through the examination of an already famed and successful actress, Onpu fathoms the beauty of looking beyond her horizons and current skill-level along with accepting her own sense of humanity and individuality. Every single one of these characters have distinct impacts on each other

ween these conditions surrounding an object or event, and said object or event never even existing? In the omniscient, this seems inconsequential. However, to the human observer connected to The Wired, with the fallibility and limited scope of perception the comes with our human brains, what then would be the situation?  What would be the outcome to someone who not only has their knowledge limited to the information that exists within The Wired, which would include the bundles of information that comprises their mind & conciousness, but also has their scope of awareness, particularly in terms of their own ignorance, limited to said information as well? The answer, with all its terrible implications, is that a comprehensive annihilation of all records and human memory would result in a state indistinguishable from not only the non-existence of said object or event, but a permanent state of unawareness from all of humankind in regards to the subject. It would literally be as if it had never even been conceived before... From here on is when things get far more complexly intertwined, splitting into two main aspects. When taking into account the events of episode 8 and 13, as well as the fact that minds that exist in The Wired are just as much projections & constructs of information as the objects that make up the world of The Wired, a tonality that, somehow, whose inklings might all but shatter any sense of sanity or well-being. It is a theme that slowly creeps into one's mind at the unravelling of each idea spoken of so far. I feel the final nails in the coffin lie within in the epitome of these ideas. Enter the boundaries of Free Will, and its implications on the concept of The Self. Return one final time to climaxes of the 8th episode. It was shown that Lain was able to erase events from reality due to the ontological nature that the existences of events can only be facilitated by the memory records of human minds... But what did the events of that episode truly imply about what a psyche is? The notion that it is bundles of information with an unspecified level of complexity has been tossed about, but a human psyche of this nature would find a ghastly truth to their existence. This truth is on the ontology behind what ultimately constructs a person's mind, which is the experiences that make up their lives. Specifically, that the construction is ontologically sourced from Lain's being(s), and ultimately her whims. Take a moment and reflect on what built any ideal one might hold in life? Experiences with abuse leading to a desire for compassion in society? A certain sort of wisdom that might lead you from acting upon selfishness and hate, perhaps? Or reflect on any accomplishments one has had? Graduation? A person you were meaningfully intimate with: A mother, and how do they shape your mind? These, ineluctably, are based in memory records.

In order to obtain this power, various magi known as ""masters"" summon legendary Heroic Spirits called ""servants"" to fight for them in a destructive battle royaleâ€”the Holy Grail War. Only the last master-servant pair standing may claim the Grail for themselves. Yet, the third war ended inconclusively, as the Grail mysteriously disappeared following the conflict.  Many years later, the magi clan Yggdmillennia announces its possession of the Holy Grail, and intends to leave the Mage's Association. In response, the Association sends 50 elite magi to retrieve the Grail; however, all but one are killed by an unknown servant. The lone survivor is used as a messenger to convey Yggdmillennia's declaration of war on the Association.  As there are only two parties involved in the conflict, the Holy Grail War takes on an unusual form. Yggdmillennia and the Mage's Association will each deploy seven master-servant pairs, and the side that loses all its combatants first will forfeit the artifact. As the 14 masters summon their servants and assemble on the battlefield, the magical world shivers in anticipation with the rise of the Great Holy Grail War.

in that while technically he is a servant of the black faction he will often go out of his way to help others that are caught in the conflict regardless of whether his orders say so or not. In this, it can be seen that Astolfo cares little about what others think of him only that his actions are in line with his beliefs and convictions. In line with his free nature, however, Astolfo is someone that believes greatly in finishing things that he has already started and will not back down from a promise that he made to someone even if the other party regrets it which points to his loyal nature. As a character, I felt that Astolfo was a well-designed and well-developed character that showed that despite not being rigidly loyal to the cause as long as your heart is in the right place you will still be able to forge your own path. His free-thinking nature combined with his determination to help those in need I felt allowed him to contrast well with the other servants of the black. His cheerful nature, as well as his ability to stay positive even in the grimmest of battles, was also another aspect of his personality that I liked. His relationship with Sieg was something that I enjoyed seeing and watching that develop over the course of the series was one of the best points of this series. I felt that his seiyuu Rumi Ookubo really did a fantastic job in voicing the character of Astolfo. AMV Animation wise I felt that the animation for the series was actually pretty good with the combat scenes being especially well designed and thought out. The individual character designs for each of the characters whether they were masters or servants I thought was another high point for the series. In particular, I really liked the designs for the uniforms that the members of the black faction wore as well as I felt that it highlighted and represented their uniformed purpose and goal and stressed the unity of the famila to accomplish it. The locations that were featured in the series I felt was also varied and well designed and did a good job of showing the different types of environments that existed in the country that the holy grail war took place in. In terms of music, the series had some really impressive opening and ending themes with my favourite ones being the first and second opening themes that were sung by Egoist and LISA and the first ending theme that was sung by GARNIDELIA. The background music for the series I felt was also pretty well done. The voice acting for the series I felt was one of the series main strong points which were helped greatly by the talented voice cast that the series had made use of. In particular, I feel that Maaya Sakamoto, Miyuki Sawashiro, Saori Hayami, Chinatsu Akasaki and Rumi Ookubo deserve particular praise as I felt that they did an excellent job in portraying their respective characters. Overall conclusion In overall, I thought that Fate/Apocrypha was a pretty good anime that had as its main strong points its strong premise, strong and unexpected story, excellent voice acting and excellent combat. Also, notable about the series was its inclusion of complex issues like the definitions of freedom, as a result, forms the main backdrop and conflict that the series main storyline makes use of. The overall storyline for the series using the backdrop of the war as its main point I felt did an excellent job of showing the struggles between the two factions as they fight for control of the holy grail and did an excellent job of showing the moves that were made by the two sides in the war. Indeed, I really enjoyed seeing the moves that both sides make as the war proceeds. While the war itself was the main focus of the series Fate/Apocrypha is also notable in that it features some unique elements not usually seen within the series such as the development of feelings between masters and servants, the definition of what life and freedom is, what makes a human being and whether servants have free will and whether or not they can defy their masters that they have a contract with. The characters of Sieg and Ruler, in particular, define the great majority of these themes as both are existences that are above the norm of what you will usually see inside the fate universe. The fact that these questions and beliefs form part of Siegâ€™s development as a character was an aspect that I particularly liked. The relationship between servants and masters has always been one of the main aspects of the Fate universe and Fate/Apocrypha's interpretation of it was by far the most interesting one as servants here are not as tightly bound to their masters as other series have shown and indeed they can choose to defy their masters if they think that a situation demands it something that I thought was welcome as it gives more life and personality to them. Overall Fate/Apocrypha was a series that I really enjoyed watching as it combined excellent combat scenes with an impressive and well thought out storyline that was full of unexpected twists which in turn was reinforced by well designed and developed characters that were portrayed by some of Japanâ€™s best seiyuuâ€™s and voice actors within the industry. The inclusion of complicated themes like freedom," I would say that Fate/ Apocrypha easily deserves a score of 10/10.""",2,,

However, while her peers have family to attend, Koyuki has no one, as her only familyâ€”her brotherâ€”died years ago. While visiting his grave, she meets two brothers named Kiri and Victor Putin chasing a strange creature. They try to assure her that they are just actors shooting a movie; Victor, however, piques Koyuki's curiosity about the old legend of the clock tower at the cemetery: if you make a wish under the clock tower at midnight during a full moon, time will turn back, allowing someone to reclaim what they have lost.  Deciding to make her wish, Koyuki learns the horrifying truth: the legend is a ruse for time demons called ""Horologues"" to steal humans' time. As they are drawn to regrets, Victor uses Koyuki as bait to lure a demon there. Kiri and Victor explain that they are Chronos Rulers, warriors who fight against the Horologues using the ""Oath of Time""â€”an item allowing them to speed up or slow down time.  With the demon destroyed and the crisis averted, Koyuki is able to go on her way free from regrets. However, she is not the only human with sorrows.

A continuation of the first 2 seasons under a new name, still adapting the online webcomics drawn by Himaruya Hidekaz.  Based on a popular web-released manga series by Hidekazu Himaruya, this has been described as a ""cynical gag"" story set in Europe in the years between WW1 and WW2 (1915-1939), using exaggerated caricatures of the different nationalities as portrayed by a gaggle of bishÅnen. For example, the Italia Veneziano character is into pasta and women. The Deutsche (German) bishi loves potatoes and sausages, and Nippon is an otaku boy. Installments of the manga have jumped back and forth in setting from the ancient times to modern-day geopolitics. The manga's title comes the Japanese words for ""useless"" (hetare) and Italy (Italia).

Unable to prove his own innocence, all hope is seemingly lost... that is until a mysterious woman named Emma appears and offers him a chance.
